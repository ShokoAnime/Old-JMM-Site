      <p>Below is a list of some of the more frequent questions that have been asked. If you don't see the question you're looking for then <a href="https://github.com/japanesemediamanager">create an issue</a> on GitHub to receive help.</p>
      <span class="anchor" id="banned-from-anidb"></span>
      <h3>Banned from AniDB?</h3>
      <p>Before continuing on, we want to make something very clear. Using any of the JMM programs or plugins <strong>WILL NOT </strong>get you banned from AniDB. JMM connects to AniDB using the provided API, something many other programs use for similar reasons. </p>
      <p>AniDB will sometimes temporarily ban a user if it detects that you   are trying to leech data. The algorithm which does this is not perfect,   so you may find yourself with a temporary ban every now and then, even if you   haven't done anything wrong.                Temporary bans can last anywhere from a few hours to more than a day   depending on the severity. </p>
      <p>If you find yourself with a temporary ban, you should not attempt   to run again for at least 12 hours, otherwise you might get a larger   ban. In our tests, large collections with over 200 series usually trigger a temporary ban. To avoid this, do not update your entire collection at once, instead do it in pieces over the course of a few hours. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="what-are-groups"></span>
      <h3>What Are Groups?</h3>
      <p>Groups are used by JMM to manage series with multiple entries giving your collection a cleaner look. JMM pulls the related series information from AniDB and automatically combines these series into a group for you, for example the series Naruto, it's OVA's and Movies would be in a group. However, you have total control over grouping and can create and delete groups to fit your needs. Additionally you can move series from one group to another and even create sub-groups within a group giving you more control over your collection. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="what-are-community-recommendations"></span>
      <h3>What Are Community Recommendations?</h3>
      <p>As previously mentioned, JMM uses AniDB as it's base to   create your collection. However AniDB is more of a technical repository   and to fill in the missing information such as episode summary, image,   fanart, posters and banners, other sites such as <a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="new">TvDB</a>, <a href="http://themoviedb.org" target="new"><strong>TMDb</strong></a> are used. This information however is not automatic and is manually   added by users and maintained by admins. So if a series has a Community   Recommendation link then that means a user like yourself submitted a link   and it was approved by an admin for others to use. Some series such as   One Piece for example will have a long list of Community   Recommendations, this does not mean you get to select one but rather   there have been multiple links submitted and approved for the series to   fix discrepancies between AniDB and TvDB providing you with the   best experience possible. </p>
      <p>Something to keep in mind when maintaining your collection is   that Community Recommendations do not automatically update on the end   user. This means that if a link is made after you've selected the   Community Recommendation then future links added regardless of the link   itself will not show up in your collection. To make it consistently   checking and automatically updating your data would make this a resource intense   task. Instead if you go to the <strong>Community Data</strong> section under the<strong> Utilities</strong> tab you'll be able to search your collection and display any incorrect   links allowing you to manually fix them. For more information on the <strong>Community Data</strong> section check out the <a href="http://japanesemediamanager.github.io/jmmdesktop_utilities.html#utilities-communitydata" target="new"><strong>Utilities</strong></a> page.</p>
      <p>In addition those with a linked <a href="http://myanimelist.net/" target="new">MyAnimeList</a> or <a href="http://trakt.tv/" target="new">Trakt.TV</a> account will see links for those series as well and cal also submit   links if there is no default one. However those who do not have a linked   account will not see them nor will they be able to add them. </p>

      <h3>I've Updated JMM Server/Desktop But Nothings Changed!</h3>
      <p>As of version <strong>3.4.4.3</strong> it has come to our   attention that the current update program being used is not properly   updating users to the latest version. A new update program will be   included in an upcoming release but in the meantime if you feel like JMM   was not updated after running the update, you can manually update by   using the links below. </p>
      <p>Manual updates are labeled as follows:</p>
      <p>Program - The program you are manually updating.<br>
        Version - The version you are updating to, for the latest version number <a href="../changelog.html">Click Here</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Program</strong>.all.to.<strong>Version</strong>.zip</p>
