      <p>This is an ongoing list of frequently asked questions that has been complied in one location to better help everyone. As these are just frequently asked questions you may not see the answer to your question, if that's the case then we recommend you<a href="https://github.com/japanesemediamanager"> create an issue</a> on GitHub to receive help.</p>
      <span class="anchor" id="banned-from-anidb"></span>
      <h3>Banned from AniDB? </h3>
      <p>Before continuing on, we want to make something very clear, using JMM <strong>WILL NOT</strong> get you banned from AniDB. JMM uses the official AniDB API and complies with all rules and guidelines for using it. </p>
      <p>The &quot;banned&quot; message you're seeing is simply telling you that you've been <strong>temporarily</strong> banned for excessive connection attempts. AniDB will sometimes  temporarily ban a user if it thinks you are attempting to leech data. By making excessive connection attempts that's usually in the range of a couple hundred attempts in a very short period of time, the algorithm they use will come to the conclusion that you are leeching data and temporarily ban you. In reality you've done nothing wrong and just need to wait out the ban which can last anywhere from a couple hours to 24 hours depending on the severity. Also keep in mind that browsing AniDB while JMM is scraping and downloading data can also increase the chance of getting a temporary ban as your creating more connection attempts. </p>
      <p>If you find yourself with a temporary ban, you should not attempt to perform any scraping or updating of AniDB data for at least 12 hours just to be sure you don't get temporarily banned again for what looks like a repeated attempt at data leeching. However if you don't want to wait then the best course of action is to split up the remaining files that need to be scraped and pause any AniDB data downloading. Do the scraping and AniDB data downloading in very small segments with 10 minute intervals. There's no guarantee this wont cause another temporary ban but should greatly reduce the chance of it happening. </p>
      <p>From out tests and data gathered from our users, attempting to scrape and download data from AniDB for a collection with over 200 different series usually triggers a temporary ban. For large collections we recommended doing the scraping and AniDB data downloading in segments. <span class="anchor" id="what-are-groups"></span> </p>
      <h3>What Are Groups?</h3>
      <p>Groups are used by JMM to manage series with multiple entries giving your collection a cleaner look and reducing what could be perceived as clutter. JMM does this automatically for you by pulling the related series information from AniDB and automatically combing these series into a group. For example, using the the anime Naruto, it's series,  OVA's and Movies would all count as separate entries in your collection but would all be in the same group. However, you have total control over grouping and can create and delete groups to fit your needs. Additionally you can move series from one group to another and even create sub-groups within a group giving you more control over your collection. </p>
      <p>For those that prefer not to group their series, this feature can be turned off in <strong>Essential</strong> section in the <strong>Settings</strong> tab. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="what-are-community-recommendations"></span>
      <h3>What Are Community Recommendations?</h3>
      <p>As previously mentioned, JMM scrapes your files and uses AniDB to compare and download your collection's data. However while AniDB is one of the best information repositories when it comes to Anime, it's doesn't deal with images or episode summaries. To get the missing data, the episode summaries, images,   fanart, posters and banners, other sites such as <a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="_blank">TvDB</a>, <a href="http://themoviedb.org" target="_blank"><strong>TMDb</strong></a> are used. Unlike AniDB, this information  is not automatic and is manually   added by users and maintained by admins. So if a series has a Community   Recommendation link then that means a user like yourself submitted a link   and it was approved by an admin for others to use. Some series such as   One Piece for example will have a long list of Community   Recommendations, this does not mean you get to select one but rather   there have been multiple links submitted and approved for the series to   fix discrepancies between AniDB and TvDB allowing your collection to be accurate and complete. </p>
      <p>Something to keep in mind while maintaining your collection is   that Community Recommendations do not automatically update on the end   user. This means that if a link is made after you've selected the   Community Recommendation,  future links added regardless of the link   itself will not show up in your collection. To make it consistently   checking and automatically updating your data would make this a resource intense   task and slow any program or plugin using JMM Server. Instead if you go to the <strong>Community Data</strong> section under the<strong> Utilities</strong> tab in JMM Desktop you'll be able to search your collection and display any incorrect   links allowing you to manually fix them. For more information on the <strong>Community Data</strong> section check out the <a href="http://japanesemediamanager.github.io/jmmdesktop_utilities.html#utilities-communitydata" target="_blank"><strong>Utilities</strong></a> page.</p>
      <p>In addition, those with a linked <a href="http://myanimelist.net/" target="_blank">MyAnimeList</a> or <a href="http://trakt.tv/" target="_blank">Trakt.TV</a> account will see links for those series as well and can also submit   links if there is no default one. However those who do not have a linked   account will not see be able to see these links nor will they be able to add and submit them. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="jmm-update-failed"></span>
      <h3>I've Updated JMM Server/Desktop But Nothings Changed!</h3>
      <p>As of version <strong>3.4.4.3</strong> it has come to our   attention that the current update program being used is not properly   updating users to the latest version. A new update program will be   included in an upcoming release but in the meantime if you feel like JMM   was not properly updated after running the update, you can manually update by   using the links below. </p>
      <p>Manual updates are labeled as follows:</p>
      <p>Program - The program you are manually updating.<br>
        Version - The version you are updating to, for the latest version number <a href="../changelog.html">Click Here</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Program</strong>.all.to.<strong>Version</strong>.zip</p>

      <h3>Does JMM Allow Me To Stream Anime From Different Sites?</h3>
      <p>This is something that's beaning looked into but at this time JMM does not support streaming anime from websites like Crunchy Roll.</p>
      <span class="anchor" id="jmm-download-anime"></span>
      <h3>Can JMM Download My Anime?</h3>
      <p>While it's not completely automatic, JMM supports uTorrent WebUI integration offering the following functions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download missing episodes, specials, openings, endings and trailers </li>
        <li>Download recently released episodes</li>
        <li>Replace existing files with a different version or fansub group. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>At this time, uTorrent is the only supported client. We are looking into adding support for additional clients. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="community-link-missing-incorrect"></span>
      <h3>My TvDB/Trakt/MyAnimeList Links Are Missing/Incorrect!</h3>
      <p>As previously mentioned in the <a href="#what-are-community-recommendations">Community Recommendations</a> section, every TvDB, Trakt and MyAnimeList link is manually added by fellow users, there is no automatic process like there is for AniDB. If the link is missing than we've never had it submitted before and it will remain missing until someone submits it and it gets approved. If you come across a missing link you can update it yourself fixing the problem and will help us and any  user that adds that series later on. Sometimes an incorrect link gets submitted and approved. If this is the case you can override the provided link with the correct link. Doing so will mark the new link as needing approval and if correct, it will replace the previous incorrect link fixing the problem for users who add the series later on.</p>
      <span class="anchor" id="files-not-imported"></span>
      <h3>My Files Are Not Being Imported!</h3>
      <p>First, double check your <a href="../jmmserver/import.html">JMM Server import settings</a> and make sure you've selected the correct options that reflects your setup. If the files are still not being added than what is likely happening is the file is most likely corrupt and the CRC does not match match any files on AniDB, in this case JMM does not know how to properly catalog the file so it marks it as an unrecognized file. Now this doesn't mean the file is corrupt, just that when it was downloading, something happens and a piece downloaded incorrectly changing the CRC value. From this point there's two different things you can do, you can re-download the file and try importing it again or simply use the <a href="../jmmdesktop/utilities.html#unrecognized-overview">Unrecognized Utilit</a>y on the Utilities tab and manually link the file. </p>
