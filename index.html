        <p>JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is a series of programs and plugins that allow you to not only watch, but manage your anime collection with a great deal of flexibility. JMM is currently composed of the following programs and plugins. </p>
        <ul>
  <li>
  <a href="#jmm-server"><strong>JMM Server</strong></a> - Shared server component</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#jmm-desktop"><strong>JMM Desktop</strong></a> - Windows application</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#my-anime3"><strong>My Anime 3</strong></a> - A plugin for MediaPortal (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
  <li> 
  <a href="#plex"><strong>Plex Agent</strong></a> - An agent for Plex</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#anime-buddy"><strong>AnimeBuddy</strong></a> - A Windows Store app for Windows 8/8.1/10</li>
</ul>
        <p>Information from various sites such as <a href="http://anidb.net/"><strong>AniDB</strong></a> and <a href="http://thetvdb.com/"><strong>TheTvDB</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank"> <strong>TMDb</strong></a> is gathered and complied to deliver the best anime experience possible. The goal of JMM is to reduce the amount of work you have to do by making everything as automated as possible. This is possible thanks to  AniDB and it's vast anime database as AniDB is used by most subbing groups as an information repository, which then allows JMM to use this information for your collection. This allows JMM to not have to rely on your files being named in a specific format which results in your files being recognized, cataloged and ready for playback with no additional work on your part. JMM also provides tools to identify and catalog your files in those rare instances where it could not be done automatically.</p>
        <p>While there are other programs out there with similar functionality, JMM differs from them as it uses a client-server based architecture called JMM Server. This means you have one central server running which keeps track of your collection, while clients like JMMDesktop, MyAnime3 and Plex Agent connect to the server to display your collection. </p>

<p>JMM Server is the heart of JMM. </p>
<p>It's responsible for all the behind the scenes work you don't have to do. JMM Server performs all the file hashing, file comparing, information compiling and image downloading and stores it all in it's shared database. With JMM Server, you can run multiple clients such as JMM Desktop or My Anime 3 across multiple computers and always keep your information centralized.</p>
