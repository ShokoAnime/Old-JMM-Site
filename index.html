      <h2>What Is JMM</h2>
      <p>JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is a series of programs and plugins that   are ideal for any anime fan looking for a way to catalog their anime   collection regardless of size without the hassle of manually inputting   each and every file. In addition, the JMM suite provides the user with   the most flexibility in managing their collection requiring minimal   input from the user allowing the user to enjoy their collection. </p>
      <p style="color: #DC0000; font-weight: 600;">JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is an anime catalog program that automatically catalogs your anime collection regardless of size and without the hassle of having to manually input each and every file in your collection. In addition, JMM provides you with the most flexibility in managing their collection  requiring minimal input from the user allowing you to enjoy their collection.      </p>
      <h3>JMM is currently composed of the following programs and plugins.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="#jmm-server">JMM Server</a> - Shared server component</li>
        <li> <a href="#jmm-desktop">JMM Desktop</a> - Windows application</li>
        <li> <a href="#my-anime3">My Anime 3</a> - A plugin for MediaPortal (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
        <li> <a href="#plex">Plex Plugin</a> - A plugin for Plex  (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
        <li> <a href="#anime-buddy">AnimeBuddy</a> - A Windows Store app for Windows 8/8.1/10</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How does JMM work? </h2>
      <p>Information from various sites such as <a href="http://anidb.net/" target="new"><strong>AniDB</strong></a>, <a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="new"><strong>TheTvDB</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/" target="new"> <strong>TMDb</strong></a> is gathered and complied to deliver the best anime experience possible. The goal of JMM is to reduce the amount of work you have to do by making everything as automated as possible. This is possible thanks to  AniDB and it's vast anime database as AniDB is used by most subbing groups as an information repository, which then allows JMM to use this information for your collection. This allows JMM to not have to rely on your files being named in a specific format which results in your files being recognized, cataloged and ready for playback with no additional work on your part. JMM also provides tools to identify and catalog your files in those rare instances where it could not be done automatically.      </p>
      <p>While there are other programs out there with similar functionality, JMM differs from them as it uses a client-server based architecture called JMM Server. This means you have one central server running which keeps track of your collection, while clients like JMMDesktop, MyAnime3 and Plex Plugin connect to the server to display your collection.</p>
      <p style="color: #DC0000; font-weight: 600;">Metadata from various data gathering sites such as <a href="http://anidb.net/" target="new"><strong>AniDB</strong></a>, <a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="new"><strong>The TV Database</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/" target="new"> <strong>The Movie Database</strong></a> is gathered and complied for use in JMM to add detailed information about the files and series in your collection which in turn allows JMM to deliver you the best anime experience possible. The main goal of JMM is to reduce the amount of work you have to by making everything as automated as possible. It's cumbersome and boring cataloging hundreds if not thousands of files so let JMM do it for you. This time saving process is possible thanks to AniDB, the top and most respected anime information repository on the internet and it's vast database of anime related data. JMM is able to compare your  files without having to rely on the filename by comparing it against AniDB's database which results in your files being recognized, cataloged and immeditly ready for playback with absolutely no additional work on your part. JMM also includes an array of advanced tools to identify and catlog any file that in those rare instances it's unable to automatically process, <span class="anchor" id="key-features"></span> </p>
      <p style="color: #DC0000; font-weight: 600;">While there are other anime catalog programs out there that provide similar functionality, there's nothing else like JMM available for use as JMM uses a client-server based architecture as it's base while other porgrams just use a client based architecture. What this means is that JMM is more than just a single program or plugin. Using JMM Server, the heart of JMM provides access to your entire collection across different clients such as JMM Desktop and Anime Buddy and media center programs like Media Portal via My Anime 3 and Plex via Plex Plugin. It doesn't matter if you're at home or away, as long as you have an internet connection, your collection is never more than a few clicks away!</p>
