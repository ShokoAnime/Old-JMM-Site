<p>JMM is the name for collection of tools that currently includes JMM Server, JMM Desktop, MyAnime3, Anime Buddy and a Plex Agent</p>

<p>These tools let you watch and manage your anime collection with a great deal of flexibility</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>JMM Server</strong> - Shared server component</li>
<li>
<strong>JMM Desktop</strong> - Windows application</li>
<li>
<strong>MyAnime3</strong> - a plugin for MediaPortal (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
<li>
<strong>AnimeBuddy</strong> - a Windows Store app for Windows 8</li>
<li>
<strong>Plex Agent</strong> - an agent for Plex</li>
</ul><p>JMM utilises information from AniDB, TheTvDB, etc and other sources to try and deliver the best anime experience possible.
JMM differs from other AniDB based clients in that it uses a client-server based architecture. This means you have one central server running which keeps track of your collection, while clients like JMMDesktop and MyAnime3 connect to the server</p>

<p>Central to the use of JMM is it's reliance on AniDB (<a href="http://anidb.net/">http://anidb.net/</a>). AniDB is used by most subbing groups who upload file information, which then allows us to look it up for our personal use
This means that JMM does not rely on having your files named in a specific format. However you name your files, JMM can identify 99% of them automatically. For the other 1% we have tools to easily mange them as well</p>

<a name="my-anime3" class="anchor" href="#my-anime3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Anime3</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.jmediamanager.org/Screenshots/MA3/Avalon/Facade_ListFanart_sm.jpg" alt="MA3 - Avalon"></p>

<p>My Anime 3 is a plugin for <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">MediaPortal</a></p>
MediaPortal is designed for use on a Home Theatre PC, and My Anime 3 allows you to list all your anime, no matter whether they are movies, TV shows, or ovas. It allows you to see detailed information about each anime you have, including description, categories, air dates, community ratings, personal ratings, etc. Fanart, DVD Covers, posters, and banners are automatically downloaded giving you a pleasing look to your anime collection. Not only are the anime listed, but each episode is listed as well. Information for each episode is available, preview pictures are downloaded, airing dates are shown, episode descriptions are retrieved, etc.</p>

<a name="jmm-desktop" class="anchor" href="#jmm-desktop"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JMM Desktop</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.jmediamanager.org/Screenshots/JMMDesktop/Dashboard_Metro_01_sm.jpg" alt="JMM Desktop - Dash 01"></p>

<p>JMM Desktop is a dedicated windows application using .NET/WPF</p>
<p>It has a lot more power and flexibility than MyAnime3, and is is covers most of the functions you might use to manage your collection of anime
Of course you can also play all your anime, and since it also connects to JMM Server like MyAnime3, any files you mark as watched from JMM Desktop will appear as watched there. So you can watch one episode from your desktop, and then watch the next one from your home theatre PC</p>

<a name="anime-buddy" class="anchor" href="#anime-buddy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Anime Buddy</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.jmediamanager.org/Screenshots/AnimeBuddy/106_05.jpg" alt="Anime Buddy 01"></p>

<p>Anime Buddy is a Windows Store app available on Windows 8</p> 
<p>You can search for it on the store, or use the following <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/en-US/app/anime-buddy/323894e2-3410-4ca5-b4a1-20e1a7d55702">link</a></p>

<h1>
<a name="jmm-server" class="anchor" href="#jmm-server"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JMM Server</h1>

<p>JMM Server is the heart of JMM</p> 
<p>It is responsible for hashing files, looking up information on AniDB, downloading all the images, managing the shared database and so on. The idea behind having a central server component is so that we can run multiple clients (MyAnime3 and JMM Desktop) across multiple computers, and always keep information centralised</p>
