      <h2>What Is JMM</h2>
      <p>JMM (Japanese Media Manager) is an anime catalog program that automatically catalogs your anime collection regardless of size and without the hassle of having to manually input each and every file in your collection. In addition, JMM provides you with the most flexibility in managing your collection  requiring minimal input from the user allowing you to enjoy their collection. </p>
      <h3>JMM is currently composed of the following programs and plugins.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="#jmm-server">JMM Server</a> - Shared server component</li>
        <li> <a href="#jmm-desktop">JMM Desktop</a> - Windows application</li>
        <li> <a href="#my-anime3">My Anime 3</a> - A plugin for MediaPortal (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
        <li> <a href="#plex">Plex Plugin</a> - A plugin for Plex  (Home Theatre PC's)</li>
        <li> <a href="#anime-buddy">AnimeBuddy</a> - A Windows Store app for Windows 8/8.1/10</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How does JMM work? </h2>
      <p>Metadata from various data gathering sites such as <a href="http://anidb.net/" target="new"><strong>AniDB</strong></a>, <a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="new"><strong>The TV Database</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.themoviedb.org/" target="new"> <strong>The Movie Database</strong></a> is gathered and complied for use in JMM to add detailed information about the files and series in your collection which in turn allows JMM to deliver you the best anime experience possible. The main goal of JMM is to reduce the amount of work you have to by making everything as automated as possible. It's cumbersome and boring cataloging hundreds if not thousands of files so let JMM do it for you. This time saving process is possible thanks to AniDB, one of the most respected anime information repository on the internet and it's vast database of anime related data. JMM is able to compare your  files without having to rely on the filename by comparing it against AniDB's database which results in your files being recognized, cataloged and immediately ready for playback with absolutely no additional work on your part. JMM also includes an array of advanced tools to identify and catalog any file that in  rare instances' it's unable to automatically process. <span class="anchor" id="key-features"></span> </p>
      <p>While there are other anime catalog programs out there that provide similar functionality, there's nothing else like JMM available as JMM uses a client-server based architecture as it's base while other programs just use a client based architecture. What this means is that JMM is more than just a single program or plugin. Using JMM Server, the heart of JMM provides access to your entire collection across different clients such as JMM Desktop and Anime Buddy and media center programs like Media Portal via My Anime 3 and Plex via Plex Plugin. It doesn't matter if you're at home or away, as long as you have an internet connection, your collection is never more than a few clicks away!</p>
      <h2>Features </h2>
      <p>Here are some of the key features JMM provides. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-server based architecture allowing for multiple clients to access your collection</li>
        <li>Ability to store your collection on both internal and external media, JMM complies it into it's database and keeps track of it all </li>
        <li>Ability to have multiple user profiles with their own collection, statistics and permissions</li>
        <li>Advanced filtering and sorting options allows you to display and update your collection data however you want</li>
        <li>Information repositories such as AniDB, The TV Database and The Movie Database supported for gathering data.</li>
        <li>Support for MyAnimeList (MAL) and Trakt.TV for importing and exporting your collection statistics.</li>
        <li>Additionally for Trakt.TV users, support for viewing what your friends are watching. </li>
