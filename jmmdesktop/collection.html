      <h2>Collection Tab</h2>
      <p>When you first select the <strong>Collections</strong> tab, you'll see two columns, the left column contains a list of pre-made and custom filters while the right column contains the preview of the selected filter. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-filter-overview.png" data-lightbox="collection-filter-overview" data-title="JMM Desktop - Filter Overview"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-filter-overview.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Filter Overview"/></a></p>
      <p>Additionally, in the right column you have two options to provide random results for the selected filter, <strong>Random Series</strong> and <strong>Random Episode</strong>. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="random-series"></span>
      <h3>Random Series</h3>
      <p>When clicked, the <strong>Random Series</strong> button will display a random series from your collection. Additionally you can further fine tune the results by specifying the watch state and adding tags to the filter list by clicking the<strong> Edit</strong> button. Note that any tag filtering done on the <strong>User</strong> section under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab will supersede any tags you select as well as the initial results shown. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-random-series.png" data-lightbox="collection-random-series" data-title="JMM Desktop - Random Series"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-random-series.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Random Series"/></a></p>
      <span class="anchor" id="random-episode"></span>
      <h3>Random Episode</h3>
      <p>When clicked, the <strong>Random Episode</strong> button will display a random series from your collection. Additionally you can further fine tune the results by and specifying the watch state and adding tags to the filter list by clicking the<strong> Edit</strong> button . Note that any tag filtering done on the <strong>User</strong> section under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab will supersede any tags you select as well as the initial results shown. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-random-episode.png" data-lightbox="collection-random-episode" data-title="JMM Desktop - Random Series"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-random-episode.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Random Series"/></a></p>
      <span class="anchor" id="group-filters"></span>
      <h3> What Are  Filters</h3>
      <p> Filters provided more control over your collection   allowing by allowing you to organize your collection in a variety of   ways. The conditions and operators you set are carried out at a series   level but shown at a group level. For example, if you have a group that   consists of three different series with two of those series being marked   as complete, a filter setup to show only <strong>Completed Series</strong> will include this group because at least one series in the group is complete.</p>
      <p>It's important to remember that each filter you add will act as an <strong>AND</strong> operator meaning a series must pass all selected conditions to be added in the filter. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="filter-basics"></span>
      <h3>Filter Basics</h3>
      <p>Adding a new group filter is simple, simply click on <strong>New Group Filter </strong>right below the <strong>Playlists</strong> tab. From here you'll be prompted to enter the name for the group   filter, once done you can now setup the filter options and different filter types.</p>
      <a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-new-filter.png" data-lightbox="collection-new-filter" data-title="JMM Desktop - Adding A New Filter"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-new-filter.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Adding A New Filter"/></a>
      <p><strong>Base Condition</strong> - The base condition is the root filter which regulates every filter you add. It has two values, <strong>Include All </strong> or <strong>Exclude All</strong> which either include all groups based on filters or exclude all groups based on filters.</p>
      <p><strong>Apply Filter At Series Level Instead Of Group Level </strong>- Enabling this setting will allow filtering to happen within a group. For example if you have a filter set to show <strong>Completed Series </strong>than   any group that contains multiple series with at least one completed   series will show up as the group is considered complete. This means that your   group filter for <strong>Completed Series</strong> contains series that   are not technically complete. By enabling this option the group will   still show up  but any series that are incomplete will not. </p>
      <span class="anchor" id="condition-types"></span>
      <h3>Condition Types</h3>
      <p>Conditions allow you to define certain rules for your filter, JMM Desktop provides a wide range of conditions allowing you complete   control over how you display your collection.</p>
      <p><strong>Air Date<br>
        </strong> Air date is the date a series<strong> FIRST </strong>started   airing. You can filter out series that started before or after your   selected date or you can select an air date that is within <strong>X </strong>days with<strong> X </strong>being the number you inputted.</p>
      <p><strong>Anime Type</strong> <br>
        This is basically a choice between TV Series, TV Special, Movie, OVA and Web. </p>
      <p><strong>Audio Language</strong> <br>
        Filter by the possible audio tracks in your collection, for example English or Japanese.</p>
      <p><strong>Category</strong> <br>
        Categories in JMM Desktop are pulled from AniDB where they are   listed as tags for the series in your collection. You can select a   single category or multiple categories for your filter.</p>
      <p><strong>Completed Series</strong> <br>
        A series is considered complete if the show has finished airing <strong>AND </strong>you have all the episodes for that series in you collection.</p>
      <p><strong>Episode Added Date</strong> <br>
        Refers to the date an episode was added to your collection. The   date for a series will be the date the latest episode was added.</p>
      <p><strong>Episode Watched Date</strong> <br>
        Refers to the date an episode was watched. The date for a series will be the date the latest episode was watched.</p>
      <p><strong>Favorite</strong> <br>
        Favorites are an exception to the <strong>Apply Filter At Series Level Instead Of Group Level </strong>rule, as they apply at the group level only.          You can toggle a group as being a favorite using the <strong>Star</strong> button when viewing a group in JMM Desktop. </p>
      <p><strong>Finished Airing</strong> <br>
        A seres is considered finished airing <strong>IF</strong> the series end date is before the current date.</p>
      <p><strong>Group</strong> <br>
        Group is an exception to the<strong> Apply Filter At Series Level Instead Of Group Level </strong>rule, as they apply at the group level.            When using this filter you will be prompted to select an existing <strong>Anime Group</strong> from your collection. Keep in mind that this condition is evaluated in a special manner than other conditions. For example if you add a condition and select the group Macross Frontier, this group will always be included in the filter regardless if it matches any other conditions. Alternatively you can use this condition to always exclude a series or group that you don't want to appear. Lastly, this condition can also be used to manually build a watch list composed of series or groups. </p>
      <p><strong>Has Unwatched Episodes</strong> <br>
        A series will pass this condition if you have episodes that are not yet watched, and also available in your collection.</p>
      <p><strong>Missing Episodes</strong> <br>
        If <strong>Any</strong> subing group has released a new episode for a series in your collection, this condition will show that series as missing an episode. For example if <strong>Fansub Group A</strong> had released episode 13 of Bleach and you only had up to episode 12 from <strong>Fansub Group B</strong>, this condition would take effect. </p>
      <p><strong>Missing Episodes (Collecting)</strong><br>
        This is the same condition as <strong>Missing Episodes</strong> with one difference, it will only look for releases from fansub groups you are collecting. For example if <strong>Fansub Group A</strong> had released episode 13 of Bleach and you only had up to episode 12 from <strong>Fansub Group B</strong>, this condition would not take effect as <strong>Fansub Group B </strong>had not released episode 13. However this condition will take effect if you are collecting from multiple fansub groups.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Rating - AniDB</strong> <br>
        This condition looks at the overall rating given by AniDB   users. You can specify a value to filter by between 0 and 10.          The actual rating value is the average value of permanent and   temporary votes combined.</p>
      <p><strong>Rating - User</strong> <br>
        This is the same as <strong>Rating - AniDB</strong> except that it only looks at your own votes.</p>
      <p><strong>Series Added Date</strong> <br>
        This looks at the date a series was added to your local   collection. It can be useful for finding what you have recently added.</p>
      <p><strong>Subtitle Language</strong> <br>
        Filter by the possible subtitle tracks in your collection, for example English or Japanese.</p>
      <p><strong>User Voted (Perm)</strong> <br>
        This is a simple condition to determine if you have voted   permanently for a series. It would usually be used in conjunction with   the <strong>Completed Series</strong> condition to determine which series are missing your votes.</p>
      <p><strong>Video Quality</strong> <br>
        Video quality looks at the original source of the files such as Blu-ray, DVD, HDTV and filters accordingly.</p>
      <span class="anchor" id="operators"></span>
      <h3>Operators</h3>
      <p>Operators are used in conjunction with conditions to provide more precise filtering of your collection. Not all operators are available for all conditions. </p>
      <p><strong>Include</strong><br>
        Generally used on true/false conditions such as <strong>Completed Series</strong> and <strong>Missing Episodes</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Exclude</strong><br>

      <p><strong>Greater Than </strong><br>

        Opposite of operator <strong>Equals</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>In </strong><br>
        For conditions where you can select more than one filter value. For example using the<strong> Category</strong> condition and selecting the categories action, mecha and school would   show any series that at least have one of these as a category. </p>
      <p><strong>Not In </strong><br>
        Opposite of operator <strong>IN</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>In (All Episodes) </strong><br>
        Same as operator <strong>In</strong> but will only evaluate to true if   all episodes/files in a series match the criteria. This can only be used   on conditions where this would make sense, such as <strong>Video Quality</strong>. </p>
      <p><strong>Not In (All Episodes)</strong> <strong><br>
        </strong>Opposite of operator <strong>In (All Episodes)</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Last 'X' Days </strong><br>
        Used for conditions which are dates, and is evaluated relative to the current date. For example you can specify an <strong>Air Date</strong> of the <strong>Last '30' Days</strong>, which means it will only show you series which have started airing in the last 30 days </p>

      <p>JMM supports linking to other sites for importing and exporting data. As previously mentioned JMM uses AniDB for almost all anime related data but also uses TvDB for images and episode information. Additionally a Trakt.TV  and/or a My Anime List account can be linked to sync watch status and rating. The Movie DB is also used for pulling information for Movies but is not fully supported at this time. </p>
      <p>By default, if you've enabled importing/exporting of your data with one of the external sites like Trakt.TV or My Anime List, each series will have it's corresponding link auto linked. However, the system is not perfect and relies on users to fix any mistakes or create the link if it does not exist. By clicking the <strong>Search</strong> button you can create the link. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-tvdb-link.png" data-lightbox="collection-tvdb-link" data-title="JMM Desktop - Series Info - Linking Series"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-tvdb-link.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Series Info - Linking Series"/></a></p>
      <p>You'll see a screen similar to this depending on which site you're creating the link for. The series name will auto-populate for you so just click the <strong>Search</strong> button. Most of the time you'll see a box called <strong>Community Recommendation</strong>, this means the series already has an approved link, click the <strong>Use This</strong> button to use that link. Now if there is not a <strong>Community Recommendation</strong> that means no one has submitted a link for that series, the good news is that if you select a link from the list, JMM will automatically submit that link and if approved, will automatically be used.</p>
      <p>Something to keep in mind, only link a series using an English link. Most of these sites are only in English aways so this shouldn't be a problem but you'll notice in the above example there are links for the series in different languages. While they all go to the same page, click the one with the <strong>British</strong> flag to use as the link even if English is not your first language. </p>

      <p><strong>File Summary</strong></p>
      <p>The file summary section shows the file information for the files in the selected series. The file listing is separated by fansub group and within a fansub group by the technical details of the files. Meaning if you started collecting <strong>HD</strong> releases of a show by <strong>Fansub Group A</strong> and then started collecting DVD releases by the same group, JMM Desktop will show two entries for <strong>Fansub Group A</strong>. You can sort this list by <strong>Quality Ranking</strong> or <strong>Release Group</strong>, the default is <strong>Quality Ranking</strong>. The summary type can also be changed from the default <strong>Quality/Release Group Details</strong> to <strong>Release Group Summary</strong> which will just show the files just by fansub group without the technical breakdown. </p>
      <p><strong>Custom Tags</strong></p>
      <p>Custom tags give you the ability to add personal tags such as a list of favorite series or series that need updating. The custom tag name is displayed in the middle with the add button on the right side. If you want to create a custom tag, click the <strong>Gear</strong> on the right side of the custom tag name. From here you can add the <strong>Tag Name</strong> and <strong>Tag Description</strong> as well as manage your custom tags. </p>
      <h3>Episodes</h3>
      <p>The episode section contains a list of all the episodes, credits, specials and trailers for the series based off the information imported from AniDB. You'll see a listing for the item even if it's not in your collection. Additionally, the item image and description is pulled from TvDB as AniDB does not support this type of data. </p>
      <p>Right below the section title, you have three different listing options, <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>Availability</strong> and <strong>Watched State</strong>. The Type <strong>listing</strong> allows you to select the type of item you want to view, you can select either <strong>Episodes</strong>, <strong>Specials</strong>, <strong>Credits</strong> or <strong>Trailers</strong>. The <strong>Availability</strong> listing allows you to select what items to show, you can switch from <strong>All Episodes</strong> which will showing everything regardless if it's in your collection, <strong>Available Files Only</strong> which will only show items that are in your collection and <strong>No Files Available</strong> which will show any item in the series that you don't have a file for. The last listing, <strong>Watched State</strong> allows you to specify the watched state by selecting either <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Unwatched</strong> or <strong>Watched</strong>. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-series-episodes.png" data-lightbox="collection-series-episodes" data-title="JMM Desktop - Episode Listing"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-series-episodes.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Episode Listing"/></a></p>
      <p>As previously mentioned above, each item has its own listing with each listing having its own image, description set of options. Starting with the buttons to the right of the name we have the <strong>Watched State</strong> which you can manually toggle a <strong>Dark Eye</strong> means the file is unwatched and a <strong>Bright Eye</strong> means the file has been watched. The <strong>Play</strong> button will play the selected item while the <strong>Green Download</strong> button will take you to the <strong>Search Torrents</strong> section in the <strong>Downloads</strong> tab and display the available downloads for the item you selected. The <strong>Playlist</strong> button will allow you to add the selected item to a playlist. The <strong>Arrow Circle</strong> button will allow you to override the TvDB link for the item, this is handy for example if a link is off due to a special being labeled as an episode on AniDB and a special on TvDB. </p>
      <p><a href="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-override-tvdb-link.png" data-lightbox="collection-override-tvdb-link" data-title="JMM Desktop - Override TvDB Link"><img src="../images/jmmdesktop/collection-override-tvdb-link.png" alt="JMM Desktop - Override TvDB Link"/></a></p>
      <p>You can select the season the correct item is in, once down click the <strong>Use This</strong> button and it will override the auto linked item with your selection. If you have the setting enabled to send data, this link will be sent to JMM and if approved will be automatically done for other users in the future. Note, this information is from TvDB so if you're looking to override a special or movie link, it will be in what's labeled as <strong>Season 0</strong>. Last we have the <strong>Force AniDB Update</strong> button which will queue the series to have its information updated to match AniDB.</p>
      <p>Each item has it's own file properties which can be viewed by clicking the <strong>Plus</strong> button to the right of the item's name. You'll be presented with a few more options and some basic information on the file, if you happen to have multiple files for the same listing, they will all show up. Like in the above menu, you have the <strong>Watched State</strong> button and <strong>Play</strong> button, the <strong>Open</strong> Folder button will open a window showing the files. The <strong>Delete</strong> button will delete the selected file so be careful while the Is Variation button will allow you to mark a file as a variation which will stop it from being reported as a duplicate or multiple file. The <strong>More Info</strong> button will open up a sub-menu showing the <strong>Hash</strong>, <strong>CRC32</strong>, <strong>SHA1</strong>, and <strong>MD5</strong> values if available. The <strong>MyList</strong> button will forcefully add the file to your My List on AniDB, the Update Info button will download the file information only for the selected item from AniDB and the <strong>Rehash</strong> button will rehash the file for comparison. The <strong>AniDB</strong> button is a link that will show the file information on AniDB.</p>

      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>The images section shows you an overview of every poster, fanart and banner downloaded for the selected series. The image source is shown above the image but most of the images shown were downloaded from TvDB. You can view a bigger version of the image by hovering your cursor over it. Each image have three options, <strong>View</strong>, <strong>Enable/Disable</strong> and <strong>Favorite</strong>, the <strong>View</strong> button will open the image in your default image viewing program, the <strong>Enable/Disable</strong> button toggles the image for display during the random rotation. The <strong>Favorite</strong> button will make the selected image the default for that series overruling the random image display. </p>

      <h3>Related And Similar</h3>
      <p>The Related And Similar section will show additional series that are connected to the selected series as well as any series that share similar concepts as reported on AniDB. If you don't have the series already in your collection, you'll notice the image missing, clicking the<strong> Get Missing Data Now</strong> button will download the missing images. How a series is related to the selected series is shown below the <strong>Related Anime</strong> title, for <strong>Similar Anime</strong> you'll see an <strong>Approval Rating</strong> instead that's calculated when someone makes a recommendation, and other people up-vote those recommendations. </p>
      <p>You also have a couple options available to you for each listed series which should look familiar. The <strong>AniDB Link</strong> will take you to the AniDB page for that series, the <strong>Pin</strong> button will pin the series, the <strong>Bookmark</strong> button will bookmark the series and the <strong>Download</strong> button will take you to the <strong>Search Torrents</strong> section in the <strong>Downloads</strong> tab and display the available downloads for the item you selected.</p>
