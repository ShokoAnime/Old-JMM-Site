This means you have one central server running which keeps track of your collection, while clients like JMMDesktop and MyAnime3 connect to the server\r\n\r\nCentral to the use of JMM is it's reliance on AniDB (http://anidb.net/). AniDB is used by most subbing groups who upload file information, which then allows us to look it up for our personal use\r\nThis means that JMM does not rely on having your files named in a specific format. However you name your files, JMM can identify 99% of them automatically. For the other 1% we have tools to easily mange them as well\r\n\r\n# Key Features\r\n\r\n* Store your anime anywhere and let JMM pull it together\r\n* Supports AniDB, The TvDB, MovieDB, MyAnimeList, Trakt.tv\r\n* Choose your database: Sqlite, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server 2008\r\n* One server, multiple clients\r\n* Create multiple users with their own watched states\r\n* Advanced filtering and sorting\r\n* Direct integration with uTorrent and multiple torrent trackers (Tokyo Toshokan, Nyaa, BakaBT and Anime Byt.es) to make downloading anime even easier\r\n* Advanced file management - file renaming, missing episodes, duplicate files, manual linking, AVDump and more\r\n* Organise and Discover - Rate your anime, Get recommendations to download or watch based on your ratings, See what your friends are watching on Trakt.tv\r\n\r\n\r\n# My Anime3\r\n\r\n![MA3 - Avalon](http://www.jmediamanager.org/Screenshots/MA3/Avalon/Facade_ListFanart_sm.jpg)\r\n\r\nFind out more about [My Anime 3](https://github.com/japanesemediamanager/Test/wiki/3.-My-Anime-3)\r\n\r\n# JMM Desktop\r\n\r\n![JMM Desktop - Dash 01](http://www.jmediamanager.org/Screenshots/JMMDesktop/Dashboard_Metro_01_sm.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
