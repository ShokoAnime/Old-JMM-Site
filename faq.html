            <p>AniDB will sometimes ban a user if it detects that you are trying to leech data. The algorithm which does this is not perfect, so you may find yourself with a ban every now and then, even if you haven't done anything wrong.
              Bans can last anywhere from a few hours to more than a day depending on the severity. </p>
            <p>If you find yourself with a ban, you should not attempt to run again for at least 12 hours, otherwise you might get a larger ban.
              In my experience it only every happens with collections of more than 200 series</p>
            <h2><a name="faq-groups" class="anchor" href="#faq-groups"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Are Groups?</h2>

            <p>Groups are used to group together related anime series</p>
        <p>Any anime that show up as related series on AniDB will automatically be placed to together in the same group. (eg Naruto and Naruto Shippuden)</p>
        <p>However you are free to create and delete groupings however you want. You can move anime from group to another, and also create sub groups within another group.        </p>
        <h2><a name="faq-communityrecommendations" class="anchor" href="#faq-anidbbanned"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Are Community Recommendations?
        </ul>
      </h2>
        <p>As previously mentioned, JMM uses AniDB as it's base to create your collection. However AniDB is more of a technical repository and to fill in the missing information such as episode summary/image, fanart, posters and banners, other sites such as  <strong><a href="http://thetvdb.com/" target="new">TvDB</a></strong>, <a href="http://themoviedb.org" target="new"><strong>TMDb</strong></a> are used. This information however is not automatic and is manually added by users and maintained by admins. So if a series has a Community Recommendation link then that means users like yourself submitted a link and it was approved by an admin for others to use. Some series such as One Piece for example will have a long list of Community Recommendations, this does not mean you get to select one but rather there have been multiple links submitted and approved for the series to fix discrepancies between AniDB and TvDB providing you the user with the best experience possible. </p>
        <p>Something to keep in mind when maintaining your collection is that Community Recommendations do not automatically update on the end user. This means that if a link is made after you've selected the Community Recommendation then future links added regardless of the link itself will not show up in your collection. To make it constantly checking and automatically updating would make this a resource intense task. Instead if you go to the <strong>Collections Data</strong> section under the<strong> Utilities</strong> tab you'll be able to search your collection and display any incorrect links allowing you to manually fix them. For more information on the <strong>Collections Data</strong> section check out the <a href="jmmdesktop_utilities.html#utilities-communitydata" target="new"><strong>Utilities</strong></a> page.</p>
        <p>In addition those with a linked <strong><a href="http://myanimelist.net/" target="new">MyAnimeList</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://trakt.tv/" target="new">Trakt.TV</a></strong><a href="http://trakt.tv/"></a> account will see links for those series as well and cal also submit links if there is no default one. However those who do not have a linked account will not see them nor will they be able to add them. </p>
        <h2><a name="faq-autoupdate" class="anchor" href="#faq-autoupdate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I've Updated JMM Server/Desktop But Nothings Changed!</h2>
        <p>As of version <strong>3.4.4.3</strong> it has come to our attention that the current update program being used is not properly updating users to the latest version. A new update program will be included in the next release but in the meantime if you feel like JMM was not updated after running the update. You can manually update by using the links below, the manual updates are labeled as follows:</p>
        <p>Program - The program you are manually updating.<br>
        Version - The version you are updating to, for the latest version number <strong><a href="changes.html" target="new">Click Here</a></strong>.</p>
