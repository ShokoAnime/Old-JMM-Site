        <h2><a name="collections-groupfilters" class="anchor" href="#collections-filters"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Group Filters</h2>
        <p>Group Filters provided more control over your collection allowing by allowing you to organize your collection in a variety of ways. The conditions and operators you set are carried out at a series level but shown at a group level. For example, if you have a group that consists of three different series with two of those series being marked as complete, a filter setup to show only <strong>Completed Series</strong> will include this group because at least one series in the group is complete.</p>
        <p>It's important to remember that each filter you add will act as an <strong>AND</strong> operator meaning a series must pass all selected conditions to be added in the filter.        </p>
        <h2><a name="groupfilters-basics" class="anchor" href="#groupfilters-basics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Filter Basics</h2>
        <p>Adding a new group filter is simple, simply click on <strong>New Group Filter </strong>right below the <strong>Playlists</strong> tab. From here you'll be prompted to enter the name for the group filter and the following two options in addition to the different filter conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Base Condition</strong> - The base condition is the root filter which regulates every filter you add. It has two values, <strong>Include All </strong> or <strong>Exclude All</strong> which either include all groups based on filters or exclude all groups based on filters.</p>
        <p><strong>Apply To Series</strong> - Enabling this setting will allow filtering to happen within a group. For example if you have a filter set to show <strong>Completed Series </strong>than any group that contains multiple series with at least one completed will show up as the group is considered complete. This means that your group filter for <strong>Completed Series</strong> contains series that are not technically complete. By enabling this option the group will still show up  but the series that are incomplete will not.        </p>
        <h2><a name="groupfilters-conditons" class="anchor" href="#groupfilters-conditons"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Condition Types</h2>
        <p>Conditions are what you set to create your group filter and JMM Desktop provides a wide range of conditions allowing you complete control over how you display your collection.</p>
        <p><strong>Air Date<br>
</strong> Air date is the date a series<strong> FIRST </strong>started airing. You can filter out series that started before or after your selected date or you can select an air date that is within <strong>X </strong>days with<strong> X </strong>being the number you inputted.</p>
        <p><strong>Anime Type</strong>
        <br>
        This is basically a choice between Movie, TV Series, TV Special, OVA and Web. </p>
        <p><strong>Audio Language</strong>
          <br>
        Filter by the possible audio tracks in your collection, for example English or Japanese.</p>
        <p><strong>Category</strong>
          <br>
        Categories in JMM Desktop are pulled from AniDB where they are listed as tags for the series in your collection. You can select a single category or multiple categories for your filter.</p>
        <p><strong>Completed Series</strong>
          <br>
        A series is considered complete if the show has finished airing <strong>AND </strong>you have all the episodes for that series in you collection.</p>
        <p><strong>Episode Added Date</strong>
          <br>
        Refers to the date an episode was added to your collection. The date for a series will be the date the latest episode was added.</p>
        <p><strong>Episode Watched Date</strong>
          <br>
        Refers to the date an episode was watched. The date for a series will be the date the latest episode was watched.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite</strong>
          <br>
          Favorites are an exception to the <strong>Series</strong> rule, as they apply at the group level only.
        You can toggle a group as being a favorite using the <strong>Star</strong> button when viewing a group in JMM Desktop. </p>
        <p><strong>Finished Airing</strong>
          <br>
        A seres is considered finished airing <strong>IF</strong> the series end date is greater that the current date.</p>
        <p><strong>Group</strong>
          <br>
          Group is an exception to the <strong>Series</strong> rule, as they apply at the group level only
          When using this filter you will be prompted to select an existing <strong>Anime Group</strong> from your collection.
          This condition is evaluated in a special manner.
          For example, if you add a condition which specified your group Macross Frontier, this group will always be included in the filter, even if it doesn't match the other conditions
        You can also this condition to always exclude a series or group that you don't want to appear, or you can manually build a watch list of series or groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Has Unwatched Episodes</strong>
          <br>
        A series will pass this condition if you have episodes that are not yet watched, and also available in your collection.</p>
        <p><strong>Missing Episodes</strong>
          <br>
          If a subbing group has released an episode which you do not have, this condition will be true.
        For example, Doki has released up to episode 13 of Bleach, but you only have up to episode 12</p>
        <p>Will include all series that are missing episodes regardless of the fansub group. </p>
        <p><strong>Missing Episodes (Collecting)</strong>
          <br>
          This is the same as <strong>Missing Episode</strong>s except that it will only look at the release groups for which you are collecting. For example if you are collecting  files from release group Doki, for the series Bleach which just had its 14th episode aired. Bleach will only show up if Doki has released episode 14 even if another group as released episode 14.</p>
        <p><strong>Rating - AniDB</strong>
          <br>
          This condition looks at the overall rating given by AniDB users. You can specify a value to filter by between 0 and 10.
        The actual rating value is an average value of permanent and temporary votes.</p>
        <p><strong>Rating - User</strong>
          <br>
        This is the same as <strong>Rating - AniDB</strong> except that it only looks at your own votes.</p>
        <p><strong>Series Added Date</strong>
          <br>
        This looks at the date a series was added to your local collection. It can be useful for finding what you have recently added.</p>

        Filter by the possible subtitle tracks in your collection, for example English or Japanese.</p>
        <p><strong>User Voted (Perm)</strong>
          <br>
        This is a simple condition to determine if you have voted permanently for a series. It would usually be used in conjunction with the <strong>Completed Series</strong> condition to determine which series are missing your votes.</p>
        <p><strong>Video Quality</strong>
          <br>
        Video quality looks at the original source of the files such as Blu-ray, DVD, HDTV and filters accordingly.</p>
