        <p>Bookmarks are a great way to keep track of shows you're interested in to download at a later point. In addition you can queue up bookmarked series to download using JMM and uTorrent to download them.</p>

        <h2><a name="bookmarks-add" class="anchor" href="#bookmarks-add"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adding Bookmarks</h2>
        <p>Currently JMM Desktop only supports adding bookmarks by viewing a series in your collection's <strong>Related and Similar</strong> tab.</p>

        <p>To add a bookmark click on the <strong>Bookmark</strong> icon that's to the right of the pinned icon. There is no confirmation message when you add a bookmark, only if you try to bookmark a series you already have bookmarked. Once you've bookmarked a series click the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> tab at the top, this will allow you to manage your bookmarks</p>

        <p>Currently there's two different types of bookmarks lists, <strong>Downloading</strong> and <strong>Not Downloading</strong>. You do not need to sort your bookmarks into one of the two categories and instead can leave them in their default category of <strong>Not Downloading</strong>. You can make changes to each bookmarked series using the options explained below. </p>
        <p><strong>Red X</strong> - Located to the right of the series name, click this button will delete the bookmark.<br>
          <strong>Download Now</strong> - If clicked will bring you to the <strong>Search Torrent</strong> section under <strong>Downloads</strong> allowing you to download the bookmarked series. Keep in mind this will search based off the series name so a series with multiple movies or OVA's will have everything show up. <br>
          <strong>Not Downloading </strong>- This is the state of the bookmarked series and is more for your benefit of keeping track of what bookmarks you've downloaded or haven't downloaded. <br>
          <strong>Priority</strong> - Changing this number will change your bookmarked series order. Once you've changed the priorities click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to see your changes. By default the priority is set to <strong>1</strong> and your list is sorted by added order.<br>
        <strong>Edit Notes</strong> - Allows you to input notes for the bookmarked series. For example what fansub group to download or release date for the next OVA or Movie. </p>
