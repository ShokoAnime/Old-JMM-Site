<h2><a name="groups" class="anchor" href="#groups"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are groups?</h2>

<p>Groups are used to group together related anime series</p>
<p>Any anime that show up as related series on AniDB will automatically be placed to together in the same group. (eg Naruto and Naruto Shippuden)</p>
<p>However you are free to create and delete groupings however you want. You can move anime from group to another, and also create sub groups within another group.</p>

<h2><a name="Banned" class="anchor" href="#Banned"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Banned from AniDB?</h2>

<p>AniDB will sometimes ban a user if it detects that you are trying to leech data. The algorithm which does this is not perfect, so you may find yourself with a ban every now and then, even if you haven't done anything wrong.
Bans can last anywhere from a few hours to more than a day depending on the severity. </p>
<p>If you find yourself with a ban, you should not attempt to run again for at least 12 hours, otherwise you might get a larger ban.
In my experience it only every happens with collections of more than 200 series</p>
