<a name="what-is-jmm" class="anchor" href="#what-is-jmm"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JMM - Group Filters</h1>

<h2><a name="Introduction" class="anchor" href="#Introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Group Filters allow you to better organise your collection.
The conditions and operators are evaluated at series level, but also shown at group level.
For example - if a group has 3 different series, and any of those series are considered "Complete" the group will show up in any filters with the "Completed Series" condition</p>
<p>If you add multiple conditions to a filter they act as an AND. Which means a series must pass all the conditions you set to be shown in the filter</p>

<h2><a name="Basics" class="anchor" href="#Basics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basics</h2>

<p><strong>Base Condition</strong> - Most of the time you will want to have this set as 'Include all'. This means you start with all groups, and the use filters to remove the ones you don't want. Selecting 'Exclude All' is only needed when you want to build a watch list by manually selecting the groups you want</p>

<p><strong>Apply To Series</strong> - By default the conditions work at the group level. If you also want to filter the series within a group you need to enable this. For Example</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a filter set to show 'Completed Series'</li>
<li>A group has 3 series in it, 2 of which are complete</li>
<li>This makes the group considered as complete</li>
<li>Opening the group will show all the series including the one that is not complete</li>
<li>If you select this option instead, the incomplete series will be hidden</li>
</ul>
