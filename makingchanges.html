        <p>The reason JMM was moved to GitHub was to allow anyone the opportunity to help contribute to the project. We actively encourage anyone to help and to submit any changes they think would benefit JMM. 
        Currently there are six projects being hosted on GitHub under the JMM name that you can help contribute too. </p>
        <p>Even simply submitting bugs or requesting new features is contributing to the project. If you believe you've found a problem or have an idea on how to improve JMM then let us know!</p>
        <h2> <a name="jmm-howtohelp" class="anchor" href="#jmm-howtohelp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JMM  - How To Help</h2>
        <p>It's extremely easy to start contributing to JMM. Simply register for a <a href="https://github.com/join" target="new"><strong>GitHub Account</strong></a>. For those who already have a GitHub account either fork the project to start working on it or submit an issue if you've found a bug or would like to request a feature. We recommend <strong><a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="new">Source Tree</a></strong><a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="new"></a> for those looking for a desktop client to manage their GitHub projects. It allows you to upload your commits allowing you to submit a pull request to have your changes merged into the main JMM projects. <br/>
